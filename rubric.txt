17.5 (points off were relatively minor things, overall an excellent job, especially on the turtlebot trajectory following)
Guidelines -0.25
1. Multiple commits with meaningful commit messages
2. No improperly tracked files in git
   src/homework2/__pycache__ should not be in the repository
3. README.md
   - Title
   - Name
   - Overview
   - Usage Instructions
   - Configuration Instructions
4. Nodes describe the python API
5. Docstrings are used
6. catkin_lint is clean
7. ROS entities are relative within nodes (where appropriate)

Part I 
1. Pause service implemented
2. Resume service implemented
3. Publish cmd_vel at a fixed frequency
4. Draw path in rviz
5. Static tf is broadcast between world and odom
6. width, height, and period parameters
7. ~pub_freq parameter is private
8. Python package setup correctly
9. Compute the trajectory and derivatives in the python package
10. rosunit tests run with catkin_make run_tests
11. rosunit tests cover the appropriate methods
12. figure_eight.launch loads parameters from trajectory.yaml
13. figure_eight.launch sets the pub_freq parameter
14. figure_eight.launch has option for running rqt_plot
15. figure_eight.launch has option for launching gazebo
16. figure_eight.launch has option for visualizing robot in rviz
17. Documentation for your calculations
18. Screencast and video


Part II -0.25
1. config/arm.yam is loaded by the xacro file
2. The arm is in the xy plane in rviz
3. Each link of the arm is a different color
4. The basic launchfile starts the robot_state_publisher
5. The basic launchfile optionally starts the joint_state_publisher_gui
6. The basic launchfile optionally starts rviz
7. The rviz configuration is loaded  by the launchfile
8. arm_traj makes the node follow the desired trajectory
9. arm_marker publishes markers
10. The overall launchfile includes the basic launchfile from step 2
11. The overall launchfile has an option to send markers to rviz
12. The overall launchfile reads parameters from arm.yaml
- The arm end-effector trajectory should be straight but there
   is a slight curve to it for some reason
